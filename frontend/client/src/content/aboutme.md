# Howdy! 
### I&rsquo;m Ben (that cool guy in the picture)
I'm a fullstack engineer with a focus on frontend, and a penchant for creating intuituve, easy-to-use interfaces for big-data applications. My main stack consists of TypeScript, React, Node and SQL - however, I dable in whatever catches my eye and/or sparks an interest.

I believe, with a deep-seated passion, that usability and accessibility are the driving forces behind not only a products success, but the determining factors in how long it stays successful. We have all seen fantastic ideas and innovations falter because they just weren't usable to the average Joe. When I take on a project, my end goal is always to bridge the gap between the end-user and the product they want, and can use intuitively. 

##### I built this site to solve a basic problem.
I wanted a single area that can serve up anything I needed it to. Be it pictures, small projects that need a home, or the random tangents that my mind occasionally produces. See something you like, have an idea, or just want to chat?
