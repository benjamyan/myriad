## Howdy! 
### I'm Ben (but you knew that)
I'm a fullstack engineer with a focus on frontend, and a penchant for creating intuituve, easy-to-use interfaces for big-data applications. My main stack consists of TypeScript, React, Node and SQL - however, I dable in whatever tickles my fancy when it gets tickled.

I believe with a deep-seated passion that usability and accessibility are the driving forces behind not only a products success, but the determining factors in how long it stays successful. We have all seen fantastic ideas and innovations falter because they just weren't usable to the average Joe. 

#### I built this site to solve a basic problem
I wanted a single area that can serve up anything I needed it to. Be it pictures, small projects that need a home, or the random tangents that my mind sometimes produces.
