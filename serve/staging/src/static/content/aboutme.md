## Who am I?
Iâ€™m a software engineer focused on modern web technologies like React, GraphQL, and serverless computing. Occasionally, I work with deep learning (AI) technologies in Python.

My by-the-bootstraps education is the subject of a chapter on grit and resilience in the bestselling book "Mindshift" by Barbara Oakley.

An angel investor once described my core soft skill in the role of founder or early team member as: "The ability to perceive exactly what needs to be done. And then to do it."

My experience working in difficult environments around the world means that I can be trusted to get things done, even when things go wrong.

In the past, I coined the term "Startup Cities" as co-founder of StartupCities.org and a startup spinoff, both of which focused on why startups should build cities. I now write about Startup Cities at StartupCities.com

I won several awards for economic research and was published or interviewed in Virgin Entrepreneur, The Atlantic's CityLab, Foreign Policy, and in academic volumes by Routledge and Palgrave MacMillan.

## Wait... what is this site?
This is my personal portfolio, inspired by the question: "What would the opposite of the two-color template developer blog look like?"
