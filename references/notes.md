### Possible features/addons
- Calendar
- Guest book
- Todo application
- "about this dev": showcase your resume here
- Messenger app that just sends an email/message to me
- Internet explorer, but you can only navigate to a website called "myPlace", that is like myspace but stupider/better. My profile picture is that one where I'm rocking the sunglasses and playing a sidescroller on win95
- Music player with a visualizer
- A Miss Honey game where the user gets all the beef on the screen until she gets so big shes breaks the window and runs off screen

### Misc additions
- Put your socials into the util menu? 
- Maybe some funky DOS sounds when loading stuff, like hard drive brrrrr
- When someone tries to enter forbidden characters or tries to mess with input areas, the jurrasic park hacker popup comes up and locks them out of the app


### bugs
- ApplicationWindow.tsx rerendering when dragging or scaling
